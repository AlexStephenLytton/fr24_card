# Lovelace FR24 card

A custom card for Home Assistant to list the aircraft that converts the [Dump1090](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090) output of your ADS-B/Mode S receiver.

![FR24 card example](readme/images/fr24card.png?raw=true "FR24 card example")

This card is developed and tested based on the output of `data/aircraft.json` of the [FlightRadar24 Pi24 image](https://www.flightradar24.com/build-your-own).

The FR24 card has many configuration options and supports multiple languages.

# Preparation

To use the card you need to create a sensor that reads the JSON from Dump1090. Add the following configuration to your `sensors.yaml`:

```yaml
- platform: rest
  name: FR24 Aircraft
  resource: http://dump1090-host/dump1090/data/aircraft.json
  value_template: "{{ value_json.messages }}"
  method: GET
  scan_interval: 15
  json_attributes:
    - now
    - aircraft
```

Update the `resource` in this configuration to the correct URL of your Dump1090 output. The `scan_interval` of 15 seconds is a suggestion, you can change this in any other value. But keep in mind that a lower interval results in a higher load on your Home Assistant environment.

After adding the sensor you need to restart Home Assistant. After restarting check the sensors in the Developer Tools if the sensor has data.

# Installation

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

Install using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) (in development), or follow [these instructions](readme/installation.md).

# Add the card to your dashboard

The card can be added to your dashboard like any other card. If you do not see the card, clear the cache of your browser and try again.

The minimal configuration of the card is only the entity of the sensor. Based on the sensor from the above example, the card can be added with the following configuration:

```yaml
type: custom:fr24-card
entity: sensor.fr24_aircraft
```

# Configuration

All configuration can be added in the configuration of the card, eg:
```yaml
type: custom:fr24-card
entity: sensor.fr24_aircraft
lang: nl
sort: track
```

The following configuration options are available:

| Option           | Type      | Default                                                                        | Accepted                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

All of the columns, except for `icon` are shown in the popup.

## Hide

With this object it's possible to set the configuration of the data that is hidden. Data must be added as an object in the yaml configuration. Example:

```yaml
type: custom:fr24-card
entity: sensor.fr24_aircraft
hide:
  old_messages: false
```

The following keys are available in the object:

| Option         | Type      | Default | Accepted        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------- | :-------- | :------ | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `old_messages` | `boolean` | `true`  | `true`, `false` | By default aircraft data which is received more than 30 seconds ago will be filtered out of the card. Setting this option to `false` will show all aircraft data that is available in the JSON file. |

# F.A.Q.

Please read our [F.A.Q.](readme/faq.md) before opening an issue.
# Contribute

You can help make this card by forking this repository and merging your changes with a pull request to the `develop` branch of this repository.

This applies not only to additions and improvements to the code, but certainly also to new [languages](src/javascript/lang/).

I am particularly interested in improvements to the registration code database. For more information about the database, click [here](readme/database.md).

# Credits

Honor where credit is due. This card could not have been made without consulting the following sources:

- The aircraft registration and country data is heavily inspired on the code from [FlightAware's Dump1090](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090);
- The popup is working thanks to the great plugins by Thomas LovÃ©n: [browser_mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod) and [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod);
- The aircraft photos in the popup are added with the use of the [Planespotters.net API](https://www.planespotters.net/photo/api).
